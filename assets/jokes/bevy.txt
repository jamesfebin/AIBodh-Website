Humorous Highlights from Rust & Bevy Communities (Last 3 Months)
r/bevy – Rust Game Engine Community
“Looking for devs” – Ambitious Teen Recruiter: A 13-year-old Bevy enthusiast posted a collaboration offer, proposing a team project with a revenue share model. The catch? In his example, “if we had four devs and a game costs 20 dollars each of us would get five dollars”

. The naivety of offering essentially $5 per dev for a game project gave the community a good laugh. (The post even attracted attention outside r/bevy, being labeled “Free Labor” on r/BeggingChoosers by amused onlookers.)
“Out of nowhere… BEVY” – IRL Meme: In a lighthearted post, a user shared a serendipitous find while searching for sunlight-readable screens: suddenly spotting the word “BEVY” in the wild

. The post (accompanied by an image/video) simply celebrated the unexpected encounter with the engine’s name in real life, earning chuckles for the sheer randomness of Bevy popping up where one wouldn’t expect it.
r/rust_gamedev – Rust Game Development
Borrow-Checker Banter – “Just use unsafe”: Rust’s strict borrow checker is a common source of humor. In a recent r/rust_gamedev advice thread, one user jokingly suggested the ultimate “solution” for borrow checker woes: “I just wrap it in unsafe. Works every time.”
reddit.com
 – a tongue-in-cheek reference to bypassing Rust’s rules entirely. (Fellow Rustaceans likely smirked at this tongue-in-cheek anti-pattern, as using unsafe liberally is the exact opposite of idiomatic Rust, but the sarcasm highlights how frustrating the borrow checker can feel at times.)
“Did you ship it yet?” – Slow Burn Joke: It’s an in-joke in the community that Rust game development can be slow. Even outside the rust_gamedev subreddit, this pops up: in one r/gamedev thread, months after a Rust project was discussed, a commenter named “--comedian--” wryly checked in: “end of year, 8 months later. did you release your rust game? just curious”
reddit.com
. The OP admitted the project had grown and release was still far off. The exchange, while good-natured, pokes fun at how Rust projects (especially games) often take longer than expected – a gentle “told you so” from fellow devs.
r/rust – The Wider Rust Community
Rust Cult Meme – “Angry Crab Worship”: The Rust language’s fandom is sometimes jokingly compared to a cult, complete with its Ferris-the-crab “mascot.” A popular meme image depicted this hilariously: an underground shrine of developers worshipping an angry crab with lightning bolts as the Grim Reaper of C looks on. It pokes fun at Rustaceans’ zealous devotion to memory safety. The caption “isRustEvil” and the over-the-top imagery highlight how outsiders see Rust fans as almost religious in their fervor

. The community embraced the joke – after all, who wouldn’t want to be part of a secret crab cult? 🦀
“Both Subs Are For Jokes” – Rust vs. ProgrammerHumor: In a bit of Reddit meta-humor, users noticed that Reddit’s recommendation banner once implied r/rust is “similar to r/ProgrammerHumor.” One cheeky post (titled “Both Subs Are For Jokes”) showed a screenshot of a user proclaiming “Goodbye, C++. Rust is the future,” right above that suggestion
programmerhumor.io
. The community found it hysterical – effectively Reddit itself joked that the Rust subreddit is one big meme. It’s a playful reminder that Rustaceans can be very enthusiastic (to the point of parody), and even the platform algorithm was in on the joke.
Each of these examples showcases the Rust community’s lighthearted side – whether it’s Bevy enthusiasts laughing at themselves, game devs sharing war stories with a sense of humor, or Rustaceans turning their own reputation into a meme. From naive recruitment posts and sarcastic coding advice to cult-of-crab memes, the last few months have proven that even in systems programming and game engine development, developers love a good laugh. The in-jokes and banter not only entertain but also strengthen community bonds – as the saying goes, “come for the language, stay for the memes!”

## **Setup** Instructions

If you haven't setup rust yet, please follow the [official guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to set it up. 

1. Create a fresh project:
   ```bash
   cargo new bevy_game
   cd bevy_game
   ```
   
2. Open `Cargo.toml` and add Bevy:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   bevy = "0.16.1"
   ```
<br>


I am going to assume you have programming experience in any one language like javascript or python.  <br><br>

## Thinking in Systems

What do we need to build a simple game that allows player to move from keyboard input?
- **World System**: Create a game world where the player can move.
- **Input System**: Monitor keyboard input and translate it into player movement.

We see the above pattern very common in building games, the pattern of create/setup and the pattern of monitoring game state changes and updating the game world entities. 

- **Setup**: Spawn enemy with different behaviors, load enemy sprites and animations, configure enemy health and damage values.
- **Update**: Move enemies toward the player, check if enemies are hit by bullets, remove dead enemies and spawn new enemies at intervals.

At the core of Bevy, we have this simple **setup and update system**. This foundational pattern is what makes Bevy both powerful and easy to understand - once you grasp this concept, building with bevy becomes easier.

```d2
direction:right

Game Start: {
  shape: circle

}

Setup System: {
  shape: rectangle

}

Update System: {
  shape: rectangle

}

Game End: {
  shape: circle

}

Game Start -> Setup System: "Initialize once"
Setup System -> Update System: "Start game loop"
Update System -> Update System: "Run every frame"
Update System -> Game End: "Player quits"

Setup System: {
  label: |md
    **Setup System**
    - Create entities
    - Load resources
    - Configure systems
    - Set initial state
  |
}

Update System: {
  label: |md
    **Update System**
    - Process input
    - Update game logic
    - Render frame
    - Handle events
  |
}
```

### Setup System

Imagine a function called setup, that gives you "commands" as an argument, and it give you spawn ability to create or spawn anything you want. Well, bevy gives you exactly that.

```rust
// Pseudo code, doesn't compile
fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
	// Create anything you want
	commands.spawn()
}
```



**What's mut?**

`mut` is short for mutate. In Rust we need to explicitly mention that we are planning to change this value. By default, Rust treats declared values as read only. `mut` tells Rust we plan to change the value. Rust uses this knowledge to prevent a whole class of bugs.

<!-- ![Mutate Comic]({{ "/assets/book_assets/chapter1-comic-1.png" | relative_url }}) -->

```comic 
left_girl_sad: Why do I need to tell Rust I'm going to change something?
right_guy_smile: Rust has rules to prevent you from making mistakes.
```

```comic 
left_girl_angry: But other languages don't make me do this!
right_guy_anxious: Exactly! That's why they let you shoot yourself in the foot!.
```

**And what's this `mut commands: Commands`?**

It's from bevy library, that allows you to add things to your game world. Rust likes explicit types, so `:Commands` lets the compiler know this parameter is Bevy's command interface. Skip the hint and Rust can't be sure what shows up, so it blocks the build.

```comic 
left_guy_sad: I wrote commands.pawn instead of spawn and the compiler yelled at me!
right_girl_surprised: Rust is like those grammar nazis.
```

**What's a type?**

A type tells Rust what kind of value you are handling—numbers, text, timers, Bevy commands, and so on. Once the compiler knows the type, it can check that every operation you perform on it actually makes sense.

**Isn't this too much work?**

It prevents mistakes and helps you with performance, ex: If you try to add a string to a number, the compiler stops you before the game runs. On top of that, knowing the exact type lets Rust pack data tightly.

A `Vec2` is just two numbers, so Rust stores exactly two numbers—no surprise extra space—which keeps things fast when you have thousands of game entities. These helps your game to be memory efficient.

When you create a Vec2 object in JavaScript or Python, you're not just storing two numbers. The runtime adds type metadata, property information, and prototype references - turning your simple 8-byte data structure into ~48 bytes of memory.

```d2


# JavaScript Vec2 container
js_vec2: JavaScript Vec2 {
  shape: rectangle


  # JavaScript Vec2 fields
  type_metadata: "type metadata"
  val_5_0: "5.0"
  val_3_2: "3.2"
  prototype_ref: "prototype ref"
  minus_48_bytes: "~48 bytes"
}

# Rust Vec2 container  
rust_vec2: Rust Vec2 {
  shape: rectangle

  # Rust Vec2 fields
  val_5_0_f32: "5.0 (f32)"
  val_3_2_f32: "3.2 (f32)"
  eight_bytes: "8 bytes"
}

# Game entities container
game_entities: 1000 Game Entities {
  shape: rectangle

  # JavaScript overhead
  js_overhead: "~48KB + overhead"

  # Rust exact memory
  rust_exact: "8KB exactly"
}

# Connections
js_vec2 -> game_entities.js_overhead
rust_vec2 -> game_entities.rust_exact

# Layout
direction: down
```


Rust's type system works at compile time. When you declare a Vec2 struct with two f32 fields, that's exactly what gets stored - just 8 bytes, no extra metadata. The compiler already knows the types, so no runtime type information is needed.

With 1000 game entities, this difference becomes dramatic:

| Language | Memory Usage | Overhead |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Rust | 8KB | None |
| Dynamic language | ~48KB+ | 6x overhead |


This isn't just about memory usage - it's about performance. Smaller, predictable memory layouts mean better CPU cache utilization, which directly translates to faster frame rates in games where you're processing thousands of entities every frame.
The compiler catches type errors before your game runs, and the tight memory packing keeps it running fast.

```comic 
left_guy_anxious: Other languages treat memory like it's unlimited!
right_girl_anxious:  Memory doesn't grow on trees! 
```


### Setting up a Camera

**What should we setup first?**

We need a camera because nothing shows on screen without one. The world can exist in data, but the camera decides what actually gets drawn.

```rust 
//Pseudo code, don't use this yet
fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
	commands.spawn(Camera2d)
}
```

**What's Camera2d?**

`Camera2d` is Bevy's built-in 2D camera bundle. Spawn it and you get a ready-to-go view of your 2D scene.

**What's a bundle?**

A bundle is just a group of components you often spawn together. For example, Bevy ships a `SpriteBundle` that packs position, texture, color tint, and visibility; spawning that bundle gives a sprite entity in one call. 

```d2


# Components container
components: Components {
  shape: rectangle

  
  # Individual components
  transform: Transform
  sprite: Sprite
  color: Color
  visibility: Visibility
}

# SpriteBundle container
sprite_bundle: SpriteBundle {
  shape: rectangle

  
  # Combined components
  combined: "Transform + Sprite + Color + Visibility"
}

# Spawn Bundle container
spawn_bundle: Spawn Bundle {
  shape: rectangle
 
  
  # Spawn call
  spawn_call: "entity.spawn(SpriteBundle)"
}

# Connections with labels
components -> sprite_bundle: "grouped into" {

}

sprite_bundle -> spawn_bundle: "spawn in one call" {

}

# Layout
direction: down
```

### Registering our setup function

We need to register our setup function with bevy to be triggered on Startup. 
```d2
# Overall layout
direction: down

# -------- main function --------
main_fn: "Main Function" {
  # lay children left->right inside this container
  direction: right

  app_new: "Bevy App Initialized\nDefault Pluging Added\nRegister setup function"
  
}

# connector note
main_fn -> startup: "hands control to Bevy"

# -------- startup phase --------
startup: "Startup Phase" {
  direction: right
  setup_once: "Run setup function\nSpawns Camera2d\nWorld ready for first frame"

}

startup -> mainloop: "enters main loop"

# -------- bevy main loop --------
mainloop: "Bevy Main Loop" {
  direction: down

  s1: "1. Run update systems"
  s2: "2. Render game world"
  s3: "3. Repeat until quit"

  # straight vertical flow
  s1 -> s2
  s2 -> s3



}

```
Update your `src/main.rs` with the following code.

```rust
// Replace your main.rs with the following code.
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
	App::new()
	.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
	.add_systems(Startup, setup)
	.run();
}

fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
	commands.spawn(Camera2d);
}
```



**What's bevy::prelude?**

`bevy::prelude` is like a starter kit, things you reach for constantly when building a game—`App`, `Commands`, components, math helpers, etc.

**What's App::new()...?**

`App::new()` creates the game application, `add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)` loads rendering, input, audio, and other systems, `add_systems(Startup, setup)` registers our startup function, and `run()` hands control to Bevy's main loop.

**Why register a startup function? What does it do?**

Startup systems run once before the first frame. We use them to set up cameras, players, and other things that should exist as soon as the window opens.

**What's bevy main loop?**

After startup, Bevy enters its main loop: it polls input, runs your systems, updates the world, and renders a frame. That loop repeats until you quit the game.

```comic 
left_guy_anxious: So the game loops forever?
right_girl_laugh: Like your dating life but with no crying!
```


Let's run it

```
cargo run
```

![Simple World Setup]({{ "/assets/book_assets/simple-world.png" | relative_url }})

A blank screen? Yup, we have only setup the camera, now let's add our player. 


## Setting up the Player

Now let's create our player! Remember our **Setup System** and **Update System** from earlier? Well, in Bevy, everything is an **Entity** with **Components** that systems can work with.

Think of an entity as a unique ID (like a social security number) and components as the data attached to it. For our player, we need components like movement speed, health, or special abilities. In Rust, the perfect way to create these components is with a **struct**.

**Wait, but didn't we say bundles hold components together?** 

Yes! **Bundles** are collections of components, while **structs** define individual components. It's like bundles are the "starter pack" and structs are the individual items inside.

`struct` is one of the core building blocks of rust. It groups similar data together. Here we declare an empty `Player` struct so the type itself acts as a tag we can attach to the player entity. Later we can add things like player health.

```rust
// Place this before main function in main.rs
#[derive(Component)]
struct Player;
```

```comic 
left_girl_sad: So the struct is empty... does that mean my player is invisible?
right_guy_laugh: No, it means he exist in spirit. You've made a philosophical protagonist
```

**Why tag?**

Tag marks an entity for later lookup. Because `Player` is attached to only our hero, systems can ask Bevy, "give me the entity with the Player tag" and work with just that one.

**What's this #[derive(component)]?**

`derive` tells Rust to attach the component macro code to this struct. A macro is Rust's way of generating  pre-defined template code for you. `#[derive(Component)]` automatically injects the boilerplate Bevy needs so it can store and find `Player` entities, saving us from copying the same glue code everywhere. We'll take a closer look at macros later in the series. This is the moment our player type becomes a component.

**What's a component, and why should the player be a component?**

A component is a piece of data attached to an entity. Position, velocity, health, and even the idea of "this is the player" all live in components. By making `Player` a component we can query for that entity later, add more components (like health or inventory), and let Bevy's systems pick out exactly the entities they need to update.

For now we will represent our character on screen using the "@" symbol. Modify the setup function.

```rust
// Replace existing setup function in main.rs with the following code
fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
    commands.spawn(Camera2d);	
    
    // Code Update Alert
    // Append the following lines to your setup function.
    commands.spawn((
        Text2d::new("@"),
        TextFont {
            font_size: 12.0,	
            font: default(),
            ..default()
        },
        TextColor(Color::WHITE),
        Transform::from_translation(Vec3::ZERO),
        Player,
    ));
}
```

`commands.spawn(( ... ))` takes that tuple and treats it as a bundle of components. This single call adds the text we want to show, its font settings, the color, the position, and the `Player` tag that identifies the entity.

**What's a tuple?**

A tuple is an ordered list of values written in parentheses. Rust keeps track of each position, so `(Text2d::new("@"), TextColor(Color::WHITE))` holds two values side by side without needing to create a struct.

**Whats an entity?**

```d2
# Player Entity at the top
player_entity: "Player Entity 43" {
  shape: rectangle

}

# Text2d component on the left

# Main components container
components: components {
  shape: rectangle


  text2d: "Text2D" {
    shape: rectangle

    text: "Text2D(\"@\")"
  }

  # TextFont component
  textfont: TextFont {
    shape: rectangle

    val_12: "12.0"
    white: "WHITE"
  }

  # Transform component  
  transform: Transform {
    shape: rectangle

    vec_zero: "Vec3::ZERO"
  }

  # Player component
  player: Player {
    shape: rectangle
 
    marker: "Marker component"
  }

  # AnimationState component
  animation_state: AnimationState {
    shape: rectangle

    facing: "Facing::Down"
    false_val: "false"
  }

  # AnimationTimer component
  animation_timer: AnimationTimer {
    shape: rectangle

    timer: "Timer(0.1s)"
  }
}

# Connections from Player Entity to components
player_entity -> components.textfont
player_entity -> components.transform
player_entity -> components.player
player_entity -> components.animation_state
player_entity -> components.animation_timer
player_entity -> components.text2d
# Layout direction
direction: down
```

An entity is the unique ID Bevy uses to tie components together. By itself it holds no data, but once you attach components to it, that ID represents something in your game world.

 Each bundle produces a new entity with a unique ID and the listed components, which you can picture like this:

| Entity | Components it carries |
| --- | --- |
| #42 | `Camera2d` |
| #43 | `Text2d("@")`, `TextFont`, `TextColor`, `Transform`, `Player` |

Once the queue flushes, those entities live in the world, ready for systems to discover them by the tags (components) they carry. We will be using this later when we want to do things like moving or animating them, or making them attack enemies, etc.


### Implementing Player Movement

Now let's create our **Update System** for player movement! Think about what we need to move a player:

1. **Keyboard input** - to know which keys are pressed
2. **Time** - to make movement smooth regardless of frame rate  
3. **Player position** - to actually move the player

In other game engines, you'd spend time manually connecting these systems together. But here's the magic of Bevy - you just ask for what you need in your function parameters, and Bevy automatically provides it!

```comic 
left_guy_surprised: Wow that saves a lot of time I spend on manually wiring things!
right_girl_laugh: Perfect! Now you can't hide behind "it's a technical limitation" anymore!  
```

Let's write our move player function. 

```rust
// Append this code to main.rs
fn move_player(
    // "Bevy, give me keyboard input"
    input: Res<ButtonInput<KeyCode>>,           
    // "Bevy, give me the game timer"
    time: Res<Time>,                            
    // "Bevy, give me the player's position"
    mut player_transform: Single<&mut Transform, With<Player>>, 
) {
    let mut direction = Vec2::ZERO;
    if input.pressed(KeyCode::ArrowLeft) {
        direction.x -= 1.0;
    }
    if input.pressed(KeyCode::ArrowRight) {
        direction.x += 1.0;
    }
    if input.pressed(KeyCode::ArrowUp) {
        direction.y += 1.0;
    }
    if input.pressed(KeyCode::ArrowDown) {
        direction.y -= 1.0;
    }

    if direction != Vec2::ZERO {
        let speed = 300.0; // pixels per second
        let delta = direction.normalize() * speed * time.delta_secs();
        player_transform.translation.x += delta.x;
        player_transform.translation.y += delta.y;
    }
}
```




**What's Res?**

Res or Resources are pieces of game-wide information that are not tied to any single entity. For example, `Res<Time>` gives you the game's master clock, so every system reads the same "time since last frame" value.

<b> Explain Single<&mut Transform, With<Player>>? <b>

```d2
direction: right
query_type: "Single<&mut Transform, With<Player>>" {
  shape: rectangle

}

# Right side - World container
world: World {
  shape: rectangle


  entity_42: "Entity #42\nCamera2d" {
    shape: rectangle
 
  }

  entity_43: "Entity #43\nTransform + Player" {
    shape: rectangle
  
  }
}

# Connections
query_type -> world.entity_42: "skipped" {

    style {
          stroke-dash: 5
    }

}

query_type -> world.entity_43: "match: With<Player>" {

}
```

`Single<&mut Transform, With<Player>>` asks Bevy for exactly one entity that has a `Transform` component and also carries the `Player` tag. The `&mut Transform` part means we intend to modify that transform or player position (Remember, we added transform component in the setup function). If more than one player existed, this extractor would complain, which is perfect for a single-hero game.

**What's Vec2::ZERO?**

`Vec2::ZERO` is a two-dimensional vector with both values set to zero: `Vec2 { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }`. We use it as the starting direction before reading keyboard input.

**What's this KeyCode::... pattern?**

`KeyCode::ArrowLeft`, `KeyCode::ArrowRight` ... are enums (will cover enums later) that represent specific keys on the keyboard. Checking `input.pressed(KeyCode::ArrowLeft)` simply asks Bevy whether that key is held down during the current frame.

We ignore zero direction so the player stands still when no keys are pressed. Once we have input, `normalize()` converts the vector to length 1 so diagonal movement isn't faster than straight movement. `speed` says how many pixels per second to move, and `time.delta_secs()` returns the frame time—the number of seconds since the previous frame—so multiplying them gives the distance we should travel this update. Finally we add that delta to the player's transform translation to move the sprite on screen.

### Registering the Movement System

```rust
// Update main function
fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
        .add_systems(Startup, setup)
        .add_systems(Update, move_player) // Line update alert
        .run();
}
```

```d2
# App Registration at the top
app_registration: App Registration {
  startup_system: "add_systems(Startup, setup)"
  update_system: "add_systems(Update, move_player)"
}

# Startup Schedule on the left
startup_schedule: Startup Schedule {
  runs_once: "Runs once before first frame"
  setup_desc: "setup() - spawn camera, player"
}

# Update Schedule on the right  
update_schedule: Update Schedule {
  runs_every_frame: "Runs every frame"
  move_player_desc: "move_player() - handle input, move entities"
}

# System Execution at the bottom
system_execution: System Execution {
  setup_exec: "setup() ← runs once"
  move_player_exec: "move_player() ← every frame"
}

# Connections
app_registration.startup_system -> startup_schedule
app_registration.update_system -> update_schedule

startup_schedule -> system_execution: "registers"
update_schedule -> system_execution: "registers"

direction: down
```

**Why is move_player added as Update? What's Update?**

`move_player` runs every frame, so we plug it into the `Update` schedule. `Update` is Bevy's built-in stage that fires once per game loop after startup is done.

**So does systems mean functions we want bevy to execute at a particular time, like initial setup or on every game loop update?**

Exactly. A system is just a Rust function you hand to Bevy with a sticky note that says "run me during Startup" or "execute me on every Update," and the engine dutifully obeys.


Let's run it.

## Adding Sprite Graphics

We'll use the Universal LPC SpriteSheet Generator to give our character some personality. You can remix body parts, clothes, and colors at [this link](https://liberatedpixelcup.github.io/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator/#?body=Body_color_light&head=Human_male_light) and export a full spritesheet.

For this project the spritesheet is already included in the [repo](https://github.com/jamesfebin/BevyGameChapter1/). Drop the provided image files into `src/assets` so Bevy can find them when the game runs. You will need to create the `assets` directory inside the src folder.

![Universal LPC Spritesheet Generator]({{ "/assets/book_assets/universal-sprite-sheet-generator.png" | relative_url }})

<br>

### Refactoring Code 

We need to add more code and adding to main.rs will make hard to read and understand.

Update your main.rs file to the following, also create another file player.rs

`mod player;` pulls in the `player.rs` module, keeping our main file slim. Splitting code like this makes it easier to grow the project without one big file doing everything.

```rust
//main.rs
use bevy::prelude::*;

mod player;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .insert_resource(ClearColor(Color::WHITE)) // We have updated the bg color to white
        .add_plugins(
            DefaultPlugins.set(AssetPlugin {
                // Our assets live in `src/assets` for this project
                file_path: "src/assets".into(),
                ..default()
            }),
        )
        .add_systems(Startup, setup_camera)
        .run();
}

fn setup_camera(mut commands: Commands) {
    commands.spawn(Camera2d);
}

```

`.insert_resource(ClearColor(Color::WHITE))` drops a global setting into the app so every frame starts with a white background.

`AssetPlugin` is Bevy's loader for textures, audio, and other assets. We tweak its `file_path` so it looks inside `src/assets`, which is where our sprites live.

### Building the Player Module

Add following lines of code in player.rs

```rust
// player.rs
use bevy::prelude::*;

// Atlas constants
const TILE_SIZE: u32 = 64; // 64x64 tiles
const WALK_FRAMES: usize = 9; // 9 columns per walking row
const MOVE_SPEED: f32 = 140.0; // pixels per second
const ANIM_DT: f32 = 0.1; // seconds per frame (~10 FPS)


#[derive(Component)]
struct Player; // Moved from main.rs to here
```

These constants give names to the numbers we reuse for the spritesheet and movement math: tile size, frames per row, walk speed, and how fast the animation advances. Moving the `Player` marker here keeps all player-specific types in one module.

### Defining Player Directions

```rust
// Append these lines of code to player.rs
#[derive(Component, Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
enum Facing {
    Up,
    Left,
    Down,
    Right,
}
```

**What's an enum?**

An enum lists a handful of allowed values. Our character only ever faces four directions, so the `Facing` enum captures those options in one place.

**Why can't I use a struct here?**

A struct would need a bunch of booleans like `facing_up:true`, `facing_left:false`, and you'd have to keep them in sync. That makes it complicated. Enum guarantees you only pick one direction.

**When to decide between using enum and struct?**

Use a struct when you need several fields, like a position with `x` and `y`, or player stats with health and stamina. Use an enum when you choose one option from a list, like which tool the player wields (sword, bow, wand) or which menu screen is active.

**Why the purpose of adding Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq macros?**

`Debug` lets us print the facing for logs, `Clone` and `Copy` make it trivial to duplicate the value, and `PartialEq`/`Eq` allow equality checks when we compare directions. 

**Why can't I copy through simple assignment, why should I add these macros?**

By default Rust moves values instead of copying them, so the compiler makes you opt in. Deriving `Copy` (and `Clone` as a helper) says "it's cheap, go ahead and duplicate it." `PartialEq` and `Eq` let us compare two facings directly, which is how we detect when the player changes direction.

**What do you mean by rust moves values, instead of copying?**

When you assign most values in Rust, the old variable stops owning it or in other words dies. Adding `Copy` keeps both variables valid.

**Why does the old variable stop owning or die when assigned?**

Rust enforces that each value has a single owner so memory can be freed safely. We'll unpack the ownership rules and borrowing in later chapters.

<br>

### Animation System Components

```rust
// Append these lines of code to player.rs
#[derive(Component, Deref, DerefMut)]
struct AnimationTimer(Timer);

#[derive(Component)]
struct AnimationState {
    facing: Facing,
    moving: bool,
    was_moving: bool,
}
```

`AnimationTimer` wraps a Bevy `Timer` so each player entity knows when to advance to the next animation frame. Each tick represents one slice of time; once the timer hits its interval we move to the next sprite in the sheet.

**What's Deref, DerefMut macros doing?**

`Deref` lets our wrapper pretend to be the inner `Timer` when we read from it, and `DerefMut` does the same for writes. That means we can just call `timer.tick(time.delta())` on `AnimationTimer` without manually pulling out the inner value first.

**So we are renaming the Timer to AnimationTimer?**

We're wrapping the timer, not renaming it. Think of `AnimationTimer` as a little box that holds a `Timer`, plus a label that says "this one belongs to the player animation." When we spawn a player we create a fresh `Timer` and tuck it into that box, so each player could have its own timer if we needed multiple heroes.

**So it's an instance of AnimationTime?**

Yes—`AnimationTimer` is a tuple struct that contains a `Timer`. We build one when we spawn the player so each entity can carry its own timer data. This pattern shows up whenever you want to attach extra meaning to an existing type without writing a brand-new API.

`AnimationState` remembers which way the player points, whether they are moving, and whether they just started or stopped. Systems read this to choose animation rows and reset frames when movement changes.

### Spawning the Player

```rust
// Append these lines of code to player.rs
fn spawn_player(
    mut commands: Commands,
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
    mut atlas_layouts: ResMut<Assets<TextureAtlasLayout>>,
) {
    // Load the spritesheet and build a grid layout: 64x64 tiles, 9 columns, 12 rows
    let texture = asset_server.load("male_spritesheet.png");
    let layout = atlas_layouts.add(TextureAtlasLayout::from_grid(
        UVec2::splat(TILE_SIZE),
        WALK_FRAMES as u32, // columns used for walking frames
        12,                  // at least 12 rows available
        None,
        None,
    ));

    // Start facing down (towards user), idle on first frame of that row
    let facing = Facing::Down;
    let start_index = atlas_index_for(facing, 0);

    commands.spawn((
        Sprite::from_atlas_image(
            texture,
            TextureAtlas {
                layout,
                index: start_index,
            },
        ),
        Transform::from_translation(Vec3::ZERO),
        Player,
        AnimationState { facing, moving: false, was_moving: false },
        AnimationTimer(Timer::from_seconds(ANIM_DT, TimerMode::Repeating)),
    ));
}

```

We load the spritesheet through the `AssetServer`, create a texture atlas layout so Bevy knows the grid, and pick the starting frame for a hero facing down. Then we spawn an entity with the sprite, transform at the origin, our marker components, and the timer that will drive animation.

`AnimationState { facing, moving: false, was_moving: false }` sets the starting direction and flags that the character is idle right now and was idle last frame. `AnimationTimer(Timer::from_seconds(ANIM_DT, TimerMode::Repeating))` creates a repeating stopwatch that fires every `ANIM_DT` seconds to advance the spritesheet.

### Movement System

```rust
// Append these lines of code to player.rs
fn move_player(
    input: Res<ButtonInput<KeyCode>>,
    time: Res<Time>,
    mut player: Query<(&mut Transform, &mut AnimationState), With<Player>>,
) {
    let Ok((mut transform, mut anim)) = player.single_mut() else {
        return;
    };

    let mut direction = Vec2::ZERO;
    if input.pressed(KeyCode::ArrowLeft) {
        direction.x -= 1.0;
    }
    if input.pressed(KeyCode::ArrowRight) {
        direction.x += 1.0;
    }
    if input.pressed(KeyCode::ArrowUp) {
        direction.y += 1.0;
    }
    if input.pressed(KeyCode::ArrowDown) {
        direction.y -= 1.0;
    }

    if direction != Vec2::ZERO {
        let delta = direction.normalize() * MOVE_SPEED * time.delta_secs();
        transform.translation.x += delta.x;
        transform.translation.y += delta.y;
        anim.moving = true;

        // Update facing based on dominant direction
        if direction.x.abs() > direction.y.abs() {
            anim.facing = if direction.x > 0.0 { Facing::Right } else { Facing::Left };
        } else {
            anim.facing = if direction.y > 0.0 { Facing::Up } else { Facing::Down };
        }
    } else {
        anim.moving = false;
    }
}
```

The query asks Bevy for the single entity tagged `Player`, giving us mutable access to its `Transform` and `AnimationState`. We build a direction vector from the pressed keys, normalize it so diagonal input isn't faster, and move the player by speed × frame time. The facing logic compares horizontal vs vertical strength to decide which way the sprite should look. We record whether the player is moving now so later systems can detect when motion starts or stops.

### Animation Implementation

```rust
// Append these lines of code to player.rs
fn animate_player(
    time: Res<Time>,
    mut query: Query<(&mut AnimationState, &mut AnimationTimer, &mut Sprite), With<Player>>,
) {
    let Ok((mut anim, mut timer, mut sprite)) = query.single_mut() else {
        return;
    };

    let atlas = match sprite.texture_atlas.as_mut() {
        Some(a) => a,
        None => return,
    };

    // Compute the target row and current position in the atlas (column/row within the 9-column row)
    let target_row = row_zero_based(anim.facing);
    let mut current_col = atlas.index % WALK_FRAMES;
    let mut current_row = atlas.index / WALK_FRAMES;

    // If the facing changed (or we weren't on a walking row), snap to the first frame of the target row
    if current_row != target_row {
        atlas.index = row_start_index(anim.facing);
        current_col = 0;
        current_row = target_row;
        timer.reset();
    }

    let just_started = anim.moving && !anim.was_moving;
    let just_stopped = !anim.moving && anim.was_moving;

    if anim.moving {
        if just_started {
            // On tap or movement start, immediately advance one frame for visible feedback
            let row_start = row_start_index(anim.facing);
            let next_col = (current_col + 1) % WALK_FRAMES;
            atlas.index = row_start + next_col;
            // Restart the timer so the next advance uses a full interval
            timer.reset();
        } else {
            // Continuous movement: advance based on timer cadence
            timer.tick(time.delta());
            if timer.just_finished() {
                let row_start = row_start_index(anim.facing);
                let next_col = (current_col + 1) % WALK_FRAMES;
                atlas.index = row_start + next_col;
            }
        }
    } else if just_stopped {
        // Not moving: keep current frame to avoid snap. Reset timer on transition to idle.
        timer.reset();
    }

    // Update previous movement state
    anim.was_moving = anim.moving;
}


// Returns the starting atlas index for the given facing row
fn row_start_index(facing: Facing) -> usize {
    row_zero_based(facing) * WALK_FRAMES
}

fn atlas_index_for(facing: Facing, frame_in_row: usize) -> usize {
    row_start_index(facing) + frame_in_row.min(WALK_FRAMES - 1)
}

fn row_zero_based(facing: Facing) -> usize {
    match facing {
        Facing::Up => 8,
        Facing::Left => 9,
        Facing::Down => 10,
        Facing::Right => 11,
    }
}
```

`let Ok((mut anim, mut timer, mut sprite)) = query.single_mut() else { return; };` both checks the result and names the pieces we need. If the query succeeds, the code binds `anim`, `timer`, and `sprite` so we can use them later. If it fails (no player, or more than one), we hit the `else` branch and exit immediately. Rust uses the `Result` type for this: `Ok` means "query returned exactly one result," `Err` means "something about that query didn't match."

After that we `match` on an `Option`, which is Rust’s "maybe there is a value" type. `Some(atlas)` means the texture atlas exists and we can tweak it; `None` means it hasn’t loaded yet, so we skip and let the next frame try again. It’s the same pattern you’d use when checking a map or cache: only use the value when the lookup returns something.

`animate_player` pulls the animation state, timer, and sprite handle for the player. It figures out which row of the atlas matches the current facing, snaps to that row when direction changes, and uses the timer to step through columns at a steady pace. When movement stops we reset the timer so the animation rests on the last frame shown. The helper functions map a facing to the correct row and frame index so the math stays readable.


### Creating the Player Plugin

```rust
// Append these lines of code to player.rs
pub struct PlayerPlugin;

impl Plugin for PlayerPlugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        app.add_systems(Startup, spawn_player)
            .add_systems(Update, (move_player, animate_player));
    }
}
```

`PlayerPlugin` is our "player module" in plug form. In Bevy, a plugin is just a struct that knows how to register systems, resources, and assets. By implementing `Plugin` for `PlayerPlugin`, we give Bevy a checklist: whenever this plugin is added to the app, run the code inside to set up everything the player feature needs. This keeps `main.rs` from becoming a tangle of player-specific calls.

The `build` method is the checklist. Bevy passes us a mutable `App`, and we bolt on the systems we care about. `spawn_player` is scheduled in `Startup` so the sprite appears as soon as the game launches. `move_player` and `animate_player` go into the `Update` schedule so they execute every frame—handling input and animation in lockstep. With everything declared here, dropping `PlayerPlugin` into `App::new()` automatically wires up the entire player flow.

**So this build function is something in built structure, which I have to write?**

Yes. The `Plugin` trait says "any plugin must provide a `build(&self, app: &mut App)` function." We implement that trait, so Rust expects us to supply the body. Bevy calls this method when it loads the plugin, which is why we add all our systems inside it.

**What's a trait?**

A trait is a contract describing what methods a type must provide. Bevy’s `Plugin` trait says "give me a `build` function so I can register your systems." By implementing that trait for `PlayerPlugin`, we hook into Bevy’s startup process and inject our own setup code. Traits let different types share behavior, `PlayerPlugin` behaves like any other Bevy plugin, but it installs our player-specific systems.



### Final Integration

```rust
// Update the main function in main.rs

use crate::player::PlayerPlugin;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .insert_resource(ClearColor(Color::WHITE))
        .add_plugins(
            DefaultPlugins.set(AssetPlugin {
                file_path: "src/assets".into(),
                ..default()
            }),
        )
        .add_systems(Startup, setup_camera)
        .add_plugins(PlayerPlugin) // Update this line
        .run();
}
```

**Why write `use crate::player::PlayerPlugin;`?**

`main.rs` sits at the root of the crate, so the `player` module lives directly under that root. The `crate::` prefix says “start looking from the top of this package,” then drill down into the `player` module to grab `PlayerPlugin`. It is the clearest way to point at a module that was declared with `mod player;` at the root level.

**So when could I just write `player::PlayerPlugin`?**

Only from inside a module that can already see `player` as a sibling. For example, code inside `src/player/mod.rs` or a child of `player` can refer to `PlayerPlugin` without the `crate::` prefix because the path is relative to that module. When you are in `main.rs`or any other file at the crate root`crate::` makes the intent explicit and keeps paths consistent even as the project grows.

Let's run it.
